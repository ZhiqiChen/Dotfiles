# My Configuration files

## Introduction and layout
Using the program "stow" we are able to use Configuration files here to put it in our home or config directories. Inspo: [youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xMTKml9O0).

Layout for files are as follows:
* non-linux files: ~/Dotfiles/
* files for things in our home: ~/Dotfiles/{program Name}/
* files for things in our .config: ~/Dotfiles/{program Name}/.config/

## Commands
* To use stow we use `stow */` to stow all configuration for linux related configs
* To make dirs for new folders use `mkdir -p ~/Dotfiles/{program}/[.config/]`



# Programs to install for new installation

* firefox (bitwarden), spotify, joplin. basic programs
* kde responsible for WM and desktop feel.
* Neovim, zsh, oh-my-zsh, for konsole
