# My Configuration files

## Introduction and layout
Using the program "stow" we are able to use Configuration files here to auto put it in our home directories [youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xMTKml9O0).

Layout for files are as follows:
* non-linux files: ~/Dotfiles/
* files for things in our home: ~/Dotfiles/[program Name]/
* files for things in our .config: ~/Dotfiles/[program Name]/.config/

## Command
To use stow we use 'stow */' to stow all configuration for linux related configs
